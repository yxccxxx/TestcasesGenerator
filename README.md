# TestcaseGenerator

Author: Yixin Chen

Project started from: 2017/11

The C++ program that can generate test cases. These file can be used to test whether another program runs correctly.
This program is inspired by my C++ testing processes when I am learning CSE 100: advanced data structures in UC San Diego.

More functions will be added, I am still working on this project.
